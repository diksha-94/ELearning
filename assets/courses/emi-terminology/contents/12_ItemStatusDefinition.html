          <h3 class="text-format">Item Status Definitions</h3>

          <p>The status of an item will determine how it can be used by merchandising
            and replenishment teams besides when the item can be eliminated from WM system
            <ul>
          <p>
          <li><b>Active -</b> An item in active status is available for the buying
            office and replenishment systems to place orders. It also allows a store
            to receive the product.
          </li>

          <p>
          <li><b>Deleted -</b> If an item is changed to deleted status, replenishment
            is shut off and stores will be unable to receive orders. After <b>90 days</b>
            of deletion status, the system will review it for activity and purge if it
            meets certain qualifications defined in the purge process.
          </li>

          <p>
          <li><b>Inactive - </b> If an item is changed to inactive status, replenishment
            is shut off and stores will be unable to receive orders. The system will not
            try to purge an inactive item until <b>13 months</b> after the status change
            was applied. This status is used on most seasonal items so the item number
            can be retained for warehouse history movement
          </li>

          <p>
          <li><b>CWO Flag - </b> The Cancel When Out (CWO) flag sets
            up an automatic deletion process on warehouse type items. When the CWO flag
              is set to 'Y', the system will stop the inbound orders to the distribution
            centers (DCs) while still allowing the stores to pull from their appropriate DC.
            When the quantities are cleared from all the warehouse slots the item will
            automatically flip to deleted status
          </li>

          <p>
          <li><b>Expiration Date -</b> The expiration date sets a specific future date
            in which the item is inactivated and deleted. When the expiration date is
            reached, the system will put the item into "Inactive" status for 90 days
            and then change to "Deleted" status
          </li>
          </ul></p>

		  <p><h4 class="text-format">Purged</h4>

          The <b>purge process</b> is used to clean up the item file. After the item is purged,
          it cannot be scanned or ordered at store level. When the item meets the criteria of
          the Deletion or Inactivation process the system will determine if there has been
          activity on an item.
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li><b>No Activity -</b> If there has not been any activity the item will be
              purged from the system and it will no longer be visible in OIF, HOST, or
              store systems. However, queries can still be pulled from Retail Link to
              gather sales data
            </li>

            <p>
            <li><b>Activity -</b> If the item had activities in the last 30 days it will
              remain "on file" in OIF, HOST, and store systems. The system looks at the item
              every week and purges it when there has been no activity for that week
            </li>
          </ul>
