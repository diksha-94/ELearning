            DSV stands for Direct ship Vendor where the orders are directly shipped to Customer.
            The DSV items are only created for sale online. These are not stored in Walmart DC's or Stores.
            The item type for DSV is 07. The supplier ships the items directly to the customer but
            Walmart still owns the inventory and handles any return process.
