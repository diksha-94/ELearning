          <p>A key benefit of the GDSN is that a foodservice supply chain
            member has one point of connectivity (i.e., their GDSN-certified data
            pool), one common format, and a common set of attributes.</p>

          <p>Additional Benefits of the GDSN include:</p>

          <ul>

            <li><b>Reliable Data</b>: The GDSN promotes reliable data by
              providing authoritative data sources that ensure that product and
              supply chain partner information is identical across IT systems and
              among trading partners.
            </li>

            <li><b>Quality Data</b>: The GDSN enhances the quality of supply
              chain information by validating that the information is properly
              defined and formatted per GS1 Standards.
            </li>

            <li><b>Current Data</b>: The GDSN utilizes a real-time,
              continuous approach to data synchronization that keeps data current
              and up-to-date.
            </li>

            <li><b>Ease of Use</b>: Using an automated approach to data
              synchronization, the GDSN converts the complex and burdensome task of
              managing product and supply chain partner information into a simple,
              efficient, behind-the-scenes process.
            </li>

            <li><b>One Collaborative Network</b>: The GDSN is unique in
              allowing all trading partners to work together using one set of
              standards and one network even if they are using competing data pools
            </li>


            <li><b>Continuous synchronization </b>: GDSN enables continuous
              synchronization of product & location information between trading
              partners. It eliminates manual processes and connects suppliers to
              the GS1 Global Registry via Data Pool Providers .
