          <p><h4 class="text-format">Composition of a UPC: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Number System Character (NSC) - The first digit of a UPC</li>
            <li>Company Prefix/ Manufacturer Code - The company prefix includes the NSC. It could be 6 to 9 digits long
              depending upon. This number uniquely identifies a company and always remains constant on all of a
              company's products.
            </li>
            <li>Product Numbers - The next set of digits that uniquely identify individual items and are arbitrarily
              assigned by each company
            </li>
            <li>Check Digit - The twelfth character in a UPC. This number is derived from a formula based upon the
              previous eleven numbers to ensure accuracy of the bar code.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><h4 class="text-format">UPC-A vs. UPC-E</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The main difference between a UPC-A and a UPC-E is the size of the barcode. The UPC-E is also called a
              0-Suppressed UPC because the UPC-E compresses a normal 12 digit UPC-A number into a six digit code by
              "suppressing" the number system digit, trailing zeros in the manufacturers code and leading zeros in the
              product number. The seventh digit is a calculated check digit using the first 6 digits of the code.
