          <p><b>GS1</b> is a neutral, not-for-profit, international organization
            that develops and maintains standards for supply and demand chains
            across multiple sectors.</p>

          <p>The whole supply chain works more efficiently when everyone
            follows the same business rules and speaks the same supply chain
            language. These rules and language are known as the GS1 System of
            Standards.</p>

          <p>Most companies initially come to GS1 to get a bar code number
            for their products. GS1 US is the GS1 Member Organization in the US.
            GS1 US is responsible for managing the GS1 System in the USA.</p>

          <p>GS1 US assigns GS1 Company Prefixes to companies/organizations
            in the USA. A GS1 Company Prefix is a unique identification number
            that GS1 US licenses to a company - and it is part of every barcode
            and identification number the company creates.</p>
