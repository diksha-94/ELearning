          <p>When suppliers want to sell their products to Wal-Mart, they are required to fill out a legal document
            called "supplier agreement". This document is sent to the Vendor Master team to assign a six digit Supplier
            number.</p>
          Every item in the Wal-mart system must have a 9-digit supplier number attached.</p>

          Composition of a 9-digit supplier number:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Supplier Number -</b> The 6-digit number assigned to the supplier by Vendor Master.</li>
            <li><b>Department Number -</b> The 2-digit department number that the item will be sold in.</li>
            <li><b>Sequence Number -</b> The last digit refers back to the supplier agreement.</li>
          </ul>
