          <p><b>GTIN</b> is an acronym for "Global Trade Item Number" and refers to
            the globally unique GS1 System identification number for products and
            services.</p>

          <p>A GTIN may be 8, 12, 13, or 14 digits in length, represented as
            GTIN-8, GTIN-12, GTIN-13, and GTIN-14, respectively. GTINs provide
            unique identification worldwide.</p>

          <p>The GTIN is encountered most frequently at point of sale and on
            cases and pallets of products in a distribution/warehouse environment.
            The GTIN is a required component of the Global Data Synchronization
            Network (GDSN) and various types of e-commerce transactions.</p>

          <p>They are most commonly used on purchase orders, and delivery and
            payment documents. Companies can be confident that a GTIN, when used
            correctly, will uniquely identify their products as they move through
            the global supply chain to the ultimate end user.</p>

          <p>This global identification system of GS1 ensures that the GTIN
            placed in a bar code or EPC is the same information contained in the
            corresponding electronic documents processed between trading partners.
