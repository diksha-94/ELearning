          <p>As described in the last page, there are five basic steps
            involved the GDSN data synchronization process:</p>

          <ol>

            <li><b>Load Data:</b> The seller or brand owner registers product and
              company information in its data pool.
            </li>

            <li><b>Register Data:</b> A small subset of this data is sent to the GS1
              Global Registry.
            </li>

            <li><b>Request Subscription:</b> The data recipient, through its own
              data pool, subscribes to receive a brand owner's information.
            </li>

            <li><b>Publish Data:</b> The brand owner's data pool publishes the
              requested information to the data recipient's data pool.
            </li>

            <li><b>Confirm & Inform:</b> The data recipient sends a confirmation to
              the seller via each company's data pool, which informs
            </li>

          </ol>
		  
          <p>
            <b>Data Pool provider </b>: An entity that provides its customer's data synchronization services
            and a single point of entry to the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) is called a
            data pool provider.
          </p>

          <p>
            Data pools must be certified per GS1 System standards to operate within the GDSN.</p>
            Example of a data pool provider: 1SYNC Data Pool.
