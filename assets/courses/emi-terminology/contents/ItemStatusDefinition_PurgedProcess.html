          The <b>purge process</b> is used to clean up the item file. After the item is purged,
          it cannot be scanned or ordered at store level. When the item meets the criteria of
          the Deletion or Inactivation process the system will determine if there has been
          activity on an item.
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li><b>No Activity -</b> If there has not been any activity the item will be
              purged from the system and it will no longer be visible in OIF, HOST, or
              store systems. However, queries can still be pulled from Retail Link to
              gather sales data
            </li>

            <p>
            <li><b>Activity -</b> If the item had activities in the last 30 days it will
              remain "on file" in OIF, HOST, and store systems. The system looks at the item
              every week and purges it when there has been no activity for that week
